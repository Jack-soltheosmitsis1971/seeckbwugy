# Kesari Chapter 2: Jallianwala Bagh - An Historical Account

Welcome. As we delve into history, some chapters are more painful, more vital than others. The proposed narrative for "Kesari Chapter 2" takes us not just to a place, but to a scar on the conscience of an empire, a turning point etched in blood and sacrifice: The Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

This is not merely a collection of facts; it is the unfolding of a profound human tragedy, a testament to courage in the face of unfathomable brutality, and a critical lesson in the cost of freedom. Let us explore this unfortunate history.

## Overview

The events at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar on April 13, 1919, represent a pivotal moment in India's struggle for independence. Occurring concurrently with the vibrant festival of Baisakhi, it was a day when peaceful assembly met with extreme, unjustified violence. This account provides the necessary historical backdrop and the sequence of events that led to, and followed, this dark day.

## Historical Context: The Seeds of Unrest

To understand the tragedy, we must first grasp the volatile atmosphere preceding it.

### Post-World War I Disillusionment

   India contributed significantly to the Allied war effort in World War I, hoping for political concessions or self-governance in return.
   Instead, promises were largely unfulfilled, leading to widespread disappointment and resentment towards the British Raj.

### The Rowlatt Act (March 1919)

   Formally known as the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919.
   This draconian law allowed the colonial government to imprison any person suspected of terrorism without trial for up to two years.
   It was widely condemned across India as the "Black Act" and sparked massive protests.

### Rising Tensions in Punjab

   Punjab, having contributed heavily to the war effort, was particularly agitated by the Rowlatt Act.
   Protests intensified in Amritsar, a major cultural and political centre.
   The arrests of two prominent leaders, Dr. Satyapal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, under the Rowlatt Act on April 10, 1919, escalated tensions dramatically.

## The Day of Tragedy: April 13, 1919

The stage was set for catastrophe on the day of Baisakhi, a harvest festival and a day of religious significance, drawing large crowds to Amritsar.

### The Gathering at Jallianwala Bagh

   Despite a government prohibition on public meetings (which many were unaware of, especially those from surrounding villages visiting for Baisakhi), a large crowd gathered in the enclosed ground of Jallianwala Bagh.
   The assembly was a mix of protestors against the Rowlatt Act and the arrests, and festival-goers seeking rest or entertainment.
   The Bagh itself was surrounded by buildings, with only a few narrow entrances, most of which were locked or easily blocked.

### The Arrival of General Dyer

   Brigadier General Reginald Dyer arrived with his troops (primarily Gurkhas and Baluchis).
   Without issuing any warning or order to disperse, Dyer positioned his soldiers at the main entrance, effectively blocking the only clear exit.

### The Unfathomable Order

   Dyer ordered his troops to open fire on the unarmed crowd.
   The firing was continuous, directed at the densest parts of the crowd, lasting for approximately 10-15 minutes.
   Official records indicate 1,650 rounds were fired.
   The targets included men, women, and children trapped within the confined space.
   Many people desperately tried to escape by climbing the walls or jumping into a well within the Bagh.

## The Immediate Aftermath

The firing ceased, but the horror lingered.

### Casualties

   Official British estimates reported 379 deaths and about 1,200 wounded.
   Indian nationalist sources and later reports placed the number of deaths much higher, likely over 1,000.
   The well in the Bagh was later found to contain numerous bodies of those who drowned while trying to escape the bullets.

### Martial Law and Further Humiliation

   Martial law was imposed across Punjab, leading to severe restrictions and punitive measures.
   Infamous orders were issued, such as the "Crawling Order" where Indians passing through a specific lane (where a British woman had been assaulted days earlier) were forced to crawl on their bellies.
   Public floggings and arbitrary arrests were common.

### The Hunter Committee Inquiry

   A British committee, headed by Lord Hunter, was established to investigate the massacre.
   While the committee condemned Dyer's actions as a "grave error" and excess, it did not impose severe punishment.
   Dyer was merely relieved of his command and forced to retire.

### Dyer's Fate and Public Opinion

   In Britain, Dyer's actions were met with mixed reactions. While the government censured him, many in the House of Lords and sections of the public supported him, even raising funds in his honour ("The Morning Post Fund").
   This response further fueled outrage and resentment in India.

## Long-Term Impact: A Nation Awakened

Jallianwala Bagh was not an end, but a catalyst.

   It profoundly shocked and enraged the Indian populace, eroding any lingering faith in the justice of British rule.
   It strengthened the resolve of the independence movement and brought figures like Mahatma Gandhi to the forefront, leading to the launch of the nationwide Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922).
   The brutality of the massacre exposed the true nature of colonial power and became a potent symbol of oppression.
   The events sowed seeds of revenge in some hearts, famously culminating decades later in the assassination of Sir Michael O'Dwyer (the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab who supported Dyer's actions) by Udham Singh in 1940, a story that adds another layer to the "untold" consequences of this day.

## Themes and Reflections

The history of Jallianwala Bagh is laden with critical themes:

   The stark contrast between peaceful aspirations and state-sponsored violence.
   The resilience and courage of ordinary people in the face of terror.
   The moral bankruptcy of unchecked power and racial superiority implicit in colonial rule.
   The ripple effects of injustice across generations.

Understanding Jallianwala Bagh is essential to grasping the intensity and sacrifices involved in India's path to freedom. It is a stark reminder of why vigilance against oppression is perpetually necessary and why the memory of those who perished must be honoured by ensuring such darkness is never repeated.

This account serves as a foundation for exploring the personal stories, the untold acts of bravery, the trauma endured, and the unwavering spirit that emerged from this devastating chapter in history, potentially forming the heart of "Kesari Chapter 2".
